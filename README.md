# Outdoorsy Fullstack Code Challenge

Thanks for applying for a full-stack role at Outdoorsy. We've put together this code challenge which should take around 4-6 hours to complete.

## Functionality
The task is to develop an app and its backing API.  Users should be taken to a list of campervans then be able to navigate to a campervan detail page. Users should be able to type keywords into a text field to filter the API results to find relevant campervans. Finish by pushing your code to Github and deploying both the API and the frontend code to Heroku or another hosting environment.

### API
Use the given Postgres database of campervans and create two endpoints. The first should return a list of campervans. The second should return a single campervan. We have a GOlang project ready to go, or you can use whatever back-end technology you are comfortable with.

#### Database

Read-only permissions:

`postgres://readonly:pa252e9d8f25738f57dcf723df55ec49357b6d1e81a4b816a789b2612a461ceb1@ec2-54-166-184-3.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d25nshigvhnsm`

### Frontend
At Outdoorsy, we primarily use two frontend technologies Next.js and Ember.js. We have created a starter project in both technologies. Choose either starter project or if you would like to use another technology please feel free.

## Visual design
We have provided a design mockup for the list view and the detail view. Feel free to elaborate on the mockups.

## Notes
- Write production ready code.
- Please make frequent, and descriptive git commits.
- Use third-party libraries or not; your choice.
- The project should look good on a mobile device as well as a desktop.
- Feel free to add functionality as you have time, but the feature described above is the priority.

## What we're looking for
- The functionality of the project matches the description above
- Visual design mostly matches designs (you're not required to be pixel perfect since the specs are rough)
- An ability to think through all potential states
- Code design and style should be consistent and reasonable


Thank you, and please reach out if you have any questions!
